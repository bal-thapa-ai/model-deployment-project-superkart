# ðŸ›’ SuperKart â€“ Sales Forecasting & Model Deployment  

SuperKart is a machine learning project designed to **forecast supermarket sales** and provide actionable insights for inventory planning, pricing, and regional sales strategies. The project demonstrates an **end-to-end ML workflow**: EDA â†’ Modeling â†’ Hyperparameter Tuning â†’ Deployment.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to validate data quality and uncover demand patterns.  
- Built models including **Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.  
- Optimized performance using **cross-validation** and **RandomizedSearchCV**.  
- Ensured **trainâ€“serve parity** by serializing preprocessing + model into a single pipeline (`pipeline.joblib`).  
- Containerized and deployed using **Flask, Gunicorn, and Docker** on **Hugging Face Spaces**.  
- Delivered insights for **inventory optimization, regional targeting, and pricing strategies**.  

---

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack  
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost  
- **MLOps & Deployment**: Flask, Gunicorn, Docker, Hugging Face Spaces  
- **Techniques**: EDA, Model Evaluation, Hyperparameter Tuning, Cross-Validation, Model Serialization  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Results  
- Accurate quarterly sales forecasting across outlets.  
- Batch and single prediction endpoints:  
  - `/predict` â†’ Batch predictions  
  - `/v1/predict` â†’ Single predictions with product & store IDs  
- Insights translated into **real business actions** for inventory and pricing.
